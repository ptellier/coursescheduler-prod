## Four Types of Schedule Recommendations
Try searching for "CPSC 110" and "CPSC 121", then selecting one of the recommended schedules.
You can choose among four different schedule criteria:
- most consistent start times ->  for students that want their first class to start at nearly the same time every day
- most compact ->   for students that need to minimize the time between when their first class starts and when their last class ends
- scattered schedules ->  for students that want as much time between classes as possible
- most free days -> for students that want to have as many days without school as possible
